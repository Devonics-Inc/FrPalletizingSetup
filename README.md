If you run into problems not mentioned on this repo, try looking at the Inovance documentation here:

## Step 1: Putting your solution together:
Start by first hooking up your solution 

## Step 2: Set up Encoder
- When setting up the rail, you may get communication errors on the encoder that read E731.0
- If you see this, do the following:
    1) Flip up the screen at the top of the encoder and press "Mode" (or "Set" first, I can't remember as im writing this). It will then allow you to modify the register value that you'd like to edit.
    2) Use the up/down arrows to adjust the values of the register until you see get "h0d.20" and press "set"
    3) Here, you should see a blinking "0". You'll need to set that to "1"  (using the up arrow) press set and then power cycle.
## Step 3: Communicating the robot to the rail:
- The provided code should have the propper UDP set up, but you'll need to give it the values the first time you set it up. Screen shots of the correct parameters can be found in this repo.
 - In "Initial"->"Peripheral"->"Ext. Axis" select Ext. Axis + UDP.
 - Change exaxis number to 1
 - Edit the "Communication config" to have the following values:

    - IP address: 192.168.57.88
    - Port number: 2021
    - Communication cycle: 2ms
    - Packet loss detection time: 50ms
    - Packet loss times: 10
    - Communication interval: 50 ms
    - Automatic reconnection after interuption: enabled
    - Reconnection period: 2ms
    - Number of reconnections: 5
    - Position completion time: 1000ms

 - Click configure, load, and then save (the checkmark at the top)
 - Navigate to "Initial"->"Base"->"Coordinate"->"Ext. Axis"
 - Select extaxis1
 - Click edit, select "param config" and enter the following values:

 - Click save and then the check mark at the top
 - Now you're good to go!

## OPTIONAL Step 4: Setting up the Extended Axis coordinate system for synchronous movement
- When setting up your extended axis, you can calibrate the extended axis to allow synchronous movement of the rail and the robot.
- After following the steps above, navigate to "Initial"->"Base"->"Coordinate"->"Ext. Axis"
- Click on the "Edit" button (notepad with a pencil icon) and towards the bottom, double click "Clear" then click "calibrate"
- As an example, these are the coordinates and steps for calibrating a vertical rail:
    - For point 1, navigate to the coordinate move tab in the main page of the web app (the bottom of the 4 icons on the left of the view window)
    - Set your Rail to 0 and enter the following coordinates:
        Point 1
        
        X 855
        
        Y 0
        
        Z 0
        
        RX 180
        
        RY 0
        
        RZ -180
    
    - For Point 2, Move the coordinates to the following:
        Point 2:

        X 855

        Y 0

        Z 0

        RX 135

        RY 0

        RZ -135

    - For Point 3, You'll need to move your rail up 100mm while moving the robot down 100mm on the Z-axis
        Point 3:
        
        X 855
        
        Y 0
        
        Z  -100
        
        RX 180
        
        RY 0
        
        RZ -180
        
        Ext Axis: 100mm

    - For point 4, first move your rail back to 0 and your robot back to 0 on the Z axis. Then, move the center point of your TCP in an axis perpendicular to your rail. In the case of a vertical rail, we move our robot in Y positive: 
        Point 4:

        X 855
        
        Y 100
        
        Z 0
        
        RX 180
        
        RY 0
        
        RZ -180
        
        Ext Axis: 0mm

- Now, when you click calculate, you can see the offsets of your new extended axis coordinate system. Click save and the check mark in the top of the window to save it. In the web app, you can view a visual representation of the axis by clicking the Extended Axis coordinate button on the top row of the view window.

- NOTE: This coordinate system will change the way you give points offsets in PTP and linear movements. Typically, in this example, the X axis will be vertical meaning to do a vertical offset, you'll need to give it an offset in the dx field.
